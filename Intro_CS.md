# Introduction to Computer Science - Curriculum Standards

## Course Overview
This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer science, including programming, computational thinking, data structures, and algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

### Unit 1: Introduction to Programming
- Understand variables, data types, and operators
- Write simple programs using sequential, conditional, and iterative structures
- Debug and test programs
- Apply problem-solving strategies

**Key Concepts:**
- Variables and data types (integers, strings, booleans, floats)
- Input and output operations
- Arithmetic and logical operators
- Control structures (if/else, loops)

### Unit 2: Functions and Modularity
- Define and call functions with parameters and return values
- Understand scope and lifetime of variables
- Break down complex problems into smaller functions
- Use built-in functions and libraries

**Key Concepts:**
- Function definition and invocation
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Local vs global scope

### Unit 3: Data Structures
- Work with lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Understand indexing and slicing
- Perform operations on collections
- Choose appropriate data structures for problems

**Key Concepts:**
- Lists and list operations
- Dictionaries and key-value pairs
- Tuples and immutability
- Iteration over collections

### Unit 4: Object-Oriented Programming
- Understand classes and objects
- Create and use instance variables and methods
- Apply inheritance and composition
- Design programs using OOP principles

**Key Concepts:**
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and methods
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance and polymorphism

### Unit 5: Algorithms and Complexity
- Analyze algorithm efficiency
- Implement searching and sorting algorithms
- Understand Big O notation
- Apply algorithmic thinking to problems

**Key Concepts:**
- Linear and binary search
- Sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion)
- Time and space complexity
- Algorithm analysis

### Unit 6: Files and Data Processing
- Read from and write to files
- Parse and process text data
- Work with CSV and JSON formats
- Handle exceptions and errors

**Key Concepts:**
- File I/O operations
- Text processing and parsing
- Structured data formats
- Error handling

## Assessment Standards

### Proficiency Levels
- **Beginning**: Can complete tasks with significant support and scaffolding
- **Developing**: Can complete tasks with minimal support
- **Proficient**: Can complete tasks independently
- **Advanced**: Can extend concepts and apply them to novel situations

### Skills Assessment
Students should be able to:
1. Write syntactically correct programs
2. Apply computational thinking to solve problems
3. Debug and test their code
4. Explain their code to others
5. Collaborate on programming projects

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Students with IEPs/504 Plans
- Provide code templates and starter files
- Break projects into smaller, manageable steps
- Allow extended time for assignments
- Offer visual aids and diagrams
- Provide glossaries of programming terms
- Use pair programming and peer support
- Allow alternative assessment methods

### For English Language Learners
- Provide vocabulary lists with translations
- Use visual programming tools when appropriate
- Allow verbal explanations in addition to written code
- Provide examples in multiple languages

### For Advanced Students
- Offer extension activities and challenges
- Introduce additional programming concepts
- Encourage independent projects
- Provide opportunities for peer teaching

## Common Accommodations
- Extended time on tests and projects
- Use of reference materials during assessments
- Step-by-step written instructions
- Frequent check-ins and progress monitoring
- Modified assignment length or complexity
- Assistive technology (text-to-speech, screen readers)
- Preferential seating near resources
- Reduced distractions during coding time
